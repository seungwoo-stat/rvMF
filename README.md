Fast generation of von Mises-Fisher distributed random vectors

Details to be added

To install and use the package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("seungwoo-stat/rvMF")
library(rvMF)
```

If error occurs during the installation, it may be related to the package `scModels` that our package depends on. Try installing `scModels` prior to the installation of `rvMF` by `install.packages("scModels")`. Also, check [this](https://github.com/fuchslab/scModels) page.
